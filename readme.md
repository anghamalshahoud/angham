# Geralds Contracting
---

This application is build for calculating the studs, posts, and plates needed for a single wall based on Geralds requirements which you can read [here](https://github.com/Focus-College/developing-software-intro-assignment-3/blob/master/assignment/user-stories.md#geralds-contracting-application-assignment-3).

## How to use this application
---
 First you need to run the following to build the application:

 ```
 tsc
 ```

 Second put your numbers in the following order:

 ```
npm start -- calc-wood-needed -n 'customer name' -w feet -i inches
```
 
 Note: I wasn't able to make the application call back the calculated houses by  thier customer name sorry for that I tried my best. 

 but if you want to see all the customer files you can go to the dist > data you'll find all of your files there! :)
